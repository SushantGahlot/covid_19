#### Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 Analysis and Forecasting
Amid these testing times where we all are fighting a Pandemic at hand, I have created this jupyter notebook(Python-3) to take an idea of how serious this pandemic is.

The virus with its origin from China has spread across the globe. China has vehemently fought with the virus and has reached a point where the spread has come to saturation. In this notebook -

* I have used the data from countries China and Italy to create a forecasting model for Australia and India. 
* There are 175 countries available in the data. 
* I have created a general-purpose function to fit and create forecasts for all the countries available (not tested)
* Contributions of any kind are welcome.

Thanks to -
* Johns Hopkins University for providing the data. Github page - [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
* The open source community for making the tools available for use.
